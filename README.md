# Sorting-Algorithms-Comparison

This application compares the running time of mergesort, selection sort, and insertion sort. They are executed on sequences of integers generated by the discrete logistic growth model. Its formula s given by

*P'* = *P* \* *r* \* (1 - *P* / *CC*),

where *r* is the reproductive rate, *CC* is the carrying capacity, *P* is the preceding population size, and *P'* is the following population size.

This application also lets users have a look at the graph comparing the three sorting algorithms.
